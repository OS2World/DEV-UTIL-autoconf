       Short Description: autoconf v2.69 for OS/2
        Long Description: autoconf v2.69 for OS/2.
Autoconf is an extensible package of M4 macros that produce shell
scripts to automatically configure software source code packages.
These scripts can adapt the packages to many kinds of UNIX-like
systems without manual user intervention.  Autoconf creates a
configuration script for a package from a template file that lists the
operating system features that the package can use, in the form of M4
macro calls.

2.61r2 : set LN_S to 'cp -f' instead of 'ln -s'.
